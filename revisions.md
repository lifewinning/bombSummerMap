Bernard Langlais section

Known for his monumental wall reliefs and sculptures of animals from the 1970s, Maine-born artist Bernard Langlais (1921–1977) produced a rich and diverse oeuvre in his 56 years. From modernist painter to visionary environment builder, Langlais created art driven by a deep sense of place, and an unrelenting search for materials and subjects that reconciled his rural roots with postwar artistic movements and ideologies. In celebration of an extraordinary bequest by the artist's widow, Helen Friend Langlais, of her estate to Colby College in 2010, the Colby College Museum of Art will present the first scholarly retrospective of Langlais's dynamic career. The exhibition is drawn primarily from the Museum's Bernard Langlais Collection and also presents loans from several local museums and private collections, a testament to Maine's deep holdings in the art of this native son.

The exhibition will be accompanied by a richly illustrated [monograph](http://www.artbook.com/9788881588817.html) with essays by Hannah W. Blunt, Diana Tuite, Vincent Katz, and Leslie Umberger.-->

#Yerba Buena

<!-- The listing looks great. I have two minor text changes that my VA team has informed me of. The exhibition dates are "Jul 18-Oct 5, 2014" and under the list of participating organizations San Quentin Prison Arts Project location is not Santa Cruz but San Quentin (HA!) and should read "San Quentin Prison Arts Project, San Quentin;"  
 -->
#Glass House
<!-- 
This looks great. Only change we have is Six Panel: Al Taylor closes July 15th not August 15th ( my mistake).

This is great thank you! -->

#Frist Center

And, directly after the Watch Me Move listing, please include:

And, one last thing. On the Watch Me Move listing, it should be "produced in the last 120 years" -- Not 150 -- that changed! Thanks so much. -->

Klein/Hammons descriptor:

An unprecedented coupling of two of the most significant artists of our time, Yves Klein and David Hammons will consist of select bodies of work by each artist that explore points of aesthetic harmony between their practices. While not the intention of the exhibition to point to notions of “influence” or direct correlations, it will focus on resonances that point to ways in which these two important figures can be understood as performing a kind of aesthetic alchemy—investing  even the humblest of materials with deep significance.   -->

#Kemper
<!-- Please refer to us as simply, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art (no need for "the" at the front of it, also there is another Kemper Museum in St. Louis that can cause some confusion).
